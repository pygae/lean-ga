# Specific algebras

This folder contains "concrete" instantiations of algebras of interest. Note that some of
the algebras in this folder have graduated to mathlib, such as:

* `clifford_algebra_ring.equiv`: any ring is a clifford algebra
* `clifford_algebra_complex.equiv`: the complex numbers are a clifford algebra
