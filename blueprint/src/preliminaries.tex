\subsection{Preliminaries}

This section introduces the algebraic environment of Clifford Algebra,
covering vector spaces, groups, algebras, representations, modules, multilinear algebras,
quadratic forms, filtrations and graded algebras.

The material in this section should be familiar to the reader, but it is worth reading
 through it to become familiar with the notation and terminology that is used,
 as well as their counterparts in Lean, which usually require some additional treatment, both
 mathematically and technically (probably applicable to other formal proof verification systems).

No details will be given as these are given in standard textbooks, such as TODO.
