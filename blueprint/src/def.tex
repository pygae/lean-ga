%     Let $(M, Q)$ be a quadratic module.

%     A \vocab{Clifford algebra} over $M$, denoted $\mathcal{G}(M)$, is
%     the quotient of the tensor algebra $T(M)$
%     by the equivalence relation $v \otimes v \sim Q(v)$.
% \end{definition}

Throughout this section:

Let $M$ be a module over a commutative ring $R$, equipped with a quadratic form $Q: M \to R$.

Let $\iota : M \lmap{R} T(M)$ be the canonical $R$-linear map for the tensor algebra $T(M)$.

Let $\iota_a : R \amap{R} T(M)$ be the canonical map from $R$ to $T(M)$, as a ring homomorphism.

\begin{definition}[Clifford relation]
  \label{def:clifford_rel}
  \lean{clifford_algebra.rel}
  \leanok

  $\forall m \in M, \iota(m) \otimes \iota(m) \sim \iota_a(Q(m))$
\end{definition}

We say that $\iota$ \vocab{is Clifford} if this relation holds.

\begin{definition}[Clifford algebra]
    \label{def:clifford_algebra}
    \lean{clifford_algebra}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:clifford_rel}

    A \vocab{Clifford algebra} over $M$, denoted $\Cl (M)$, is
    the quotient of the tensor algebra $T(M)$
    by the equivalence relation \ref{def:clifford_rel}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  \label{mk:two_sided_ideals}
  
  In literatures, $M$ is often written $V$, and the quotient is taken by the two-sided ideal $I_Q$ generated from the set
  $\{ v \otimes v - Q(v) \:\vert\: v \in V \}$.

  As of writing, mathlib does not have direct support for two-sided ideals,
  but it does support the equivalent operation of taking the quotient by a suitable closure of
  a relation like $v \otimes v \sim Q(v)$.

  Hence the definition above.

\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Clifford algebra over a vector space]
  \label{ex:clifford_algebra_v}

  Let $V$ be a vector space over $\RR$, equipped with a quadratic form $Q$.
  
  Since $\RR$ is a commutative ring and $V$ is a module,
  definition \ref{def:clifford_algebra} of Clifford algebra applies.
\end{example}
